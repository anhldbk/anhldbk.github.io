overview:
  - Experienced and impactful engineering leader, blogger and speaker. I am motivated and enthusiastic by new challenges in business, product & technology. My latest adventure is in Payment industry to make Vietnam a cashless country with ZaloPay.
  - "Here are quick things about me & my work:"
  - 1. Initially I worked in the Security industry. I published various researches. The very first Google Chrome's vulnerability is reported by me.
  - 2. Later I also had a chance to lead a team to build https://reputa.vn/, a social listening product. It was a great time to work with the brightest minds in Distributed Systems & Machine Learning. I founded Vietnam Data Scientists, a Facebook community with 20k+ members as in 2022.
  - 3. I've helped ZaloPay to create a scalable ledger. In the near future, we aim for 30k tps. It's really a big challenge.
  - "4. I love open engineering culture. I've contributed to various open-source projects, e.g.: Apache Avro, Redis, Quarkus. At ZaloPay, I've initiated & led programs for Open Source (https://github.com/zalopay-oss) and Engineering Blog (https://engineering.zalopay.vn/). Sharing is caring. The programs are ways to nurture & attract more talents."
  - 5. I love growing people. I designed courses & trained freshers.
  - 6. I'm shifting my mindset to be product-oriented. Marty Cagan is my favorite product guru. I'm interested in using Wardley Mapping in developing strategies.

projects:
  - name: Unicode Shellcode and Improvements (paper)
    link: "/resources/unicode_shellcode_2008.pdf"
    detail: Buffer overflow bugs are amongst the most prevalent and the most critical bugs today. On exploiting these bugs, we often encounter the problem of Unicode format which prevents our shellcodes from executing properly. This documentation will cover conventional methods to write a Unicode shellcode and the improvements that we have applied.
