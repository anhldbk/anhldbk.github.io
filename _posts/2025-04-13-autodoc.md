For legal professionals, efficiency is paramount. While juggling deadlines and complex paperwork, the need for a reliable, distraction-free document generator becomes clear. That's why I created AutoDoc, a browser-based app designed to automate document creations.

Built with NextJS, AutoDoc harnesses modern web development to deliver speed and security. The app processes everything locally within your browserâ€”your data stays private, and there's no need for sign-ups or downloads. This makes it ideal for creating contracts, letters, or bulk documents seamlessly.

The inspiration behind this app is close to home. My wife, a legal executive, often faced challenges with generating personalized documents at scale. Seeing an opportunity to help, I developed AutoDoc to simplify her workflow and save her countless hours. Now, she can generate documents efficiently and focus more on meaningful tasks.

Creating AutoDoc was an exciting journey, and I had some great help along the way. I used Claude Sonnet 3.7, a coding assistant that provided insights and guidance to bring this idea to life. It helped me optimize the app and ensure it delivered a user-friendly experience.

The app is completely free and accessible at [https://getautodoc.vercel.app/](https://getautodoc.vercel.app/). Whether you're a legal professional or just someone seeking a smarter way to manage templates, give it a try! I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement.
